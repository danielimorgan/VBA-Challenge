# VBA-Challenge
The file titled VBA Stocks.bas consists of 2 VBA scripts. Stock_Tickers.bas should be ran first in order to get a snapshot summary of each ticker symbol across all worksheets in the excel document.
The second script, Great_Stocks.bas, should be ran afterwards, which will find the tickers who qualify for each greatest category and display it on each worksheet of the excel document.
The image file shows screenshots of the VBA script results of each worksheet when ran in the correct sequence of files.
